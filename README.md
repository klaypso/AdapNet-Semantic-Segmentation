# AdapNet:  Adaptive  Semantic  Segmentation in  Adverse  Environmental  Conditions
AdapNet is a deep learning model used for semantic image segmentation, aiming to assign semantic labels (such as car, road, tree, etc.) to every pixel in the input image. It's easily trainable on a single GPU with 12 GB of memory with a quick inference time. It has been benchmarked on Cityscapes, Synthia, ScanNet, SUN RGB-D, and Freiburg For
